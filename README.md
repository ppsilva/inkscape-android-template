# inkscape-android-template

## Intro
After a discussion with a fellow friend of mine (Dev.) and his complaints about the lack of templates for android layout on Inkscape... I decided to start something like that with all guidelines, padding, etc.. The only requirement: everything needs to be done with Inkscape.

## One file, multiple screens
### Part I 
the idea is to have a couple of nexus "screens"(parent layers) featuring different components and their specs including color. Right now I didn't pay any attention to any of the components' color (apart from the text) 

### Part II
Ideally, at the end, I would like to make not only one SVG file but many:
- File with all components
- Screens folder with each screen exported as one SVG file
- Components folder with each component exported as one SVG file

### Part III
Set up for every asset inside of a component (e.g.: icon) export and proceed by exporting these examples to a assets folder and respective densities.

## Layer Structure
